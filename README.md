# Dynamic_Programming
This Repository contains several Program codes based on the concepts of Dynamic Programming in Data Structures and Algorithms.

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. 
Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 

The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. 
This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.

It helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property.

If any problem can be divided into subproblems, which in turn are divided into smaller subproblems, and if there are overlapping among these subproblems, then the
solutions to these subproblems can be saved for future reference. 
In this way, efficiency of the CPU can be enhanced. This method of solving a solution is referred to as dynamic programming.

Such problems involve repeatedly calculating the value of the same subproblems to find the optimum solution.
